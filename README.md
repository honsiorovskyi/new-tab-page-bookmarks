## Preview

## Description

- does NOT manage your bookmarks, the built-in bookmarks manager for that (CMD+ALT+B / CTRL+SHIFT+O)
- does NOT sync your bookmarks, Chrome already does that
- there are NO settings, deal with it
- just displays your bookmarks in multiple columns for quick access from the new tab page
- displays favicons for your bookmarks (via Google API)


## Permission justification

Extension requires [permissions to access your bookmarks](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/bookmarks/) to display them on the new tab page. Your bookmarks do not leave your device. It loads favicons via Google API ([using t2.gstatic.com/faviconV2 like this](https://t2.gstatic.com/faviconV2?client=SOCIAL&type=FAVICON&fallback_opts=TYPE,SIZE,URL&url=http://github.com&size=16)) and might disclose domains & subdomains (not full URLs) from your bookmarks to Google.


## Development

Run `yarn build` to zip the extension for the purpose of uploading to Chrome Web Store.
